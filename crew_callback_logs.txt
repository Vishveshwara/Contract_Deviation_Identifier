The contract content provided does not exactly match the template. The following deviations are identified:

* **Clause 1:** The template mentions "Purpose" as a clause, but the contract content does not have a separate clause for "Purpose". Instead, it is mentioned in the introduction.
* **Clause 2:** The template defines "Confidential Information", but the contract content does not provide a specific definition.
* **Clause 3:** The template mentions "Obligations of the Receiving Party", but the contract content only mentions three obligations: maintain confidentiality, use Confidential Information solely for the purpose of evaluating or engaging in discussions, and restrict disclosure.
* **Clause 4:** The template mentions "Exclusions from Confidential Information", but the contract content does not have a separate clause for this.
* **Clause 5:** The template mentions "Term", but the contract content does not provide a specific term for the agreement.
* **Clause 6:** The template mentions "Return of Materials", but the contract content only mentions the return or destruction of materials containing Confidential Information.
* **Clause 8:** The template mentions "Governing Law", but the contract content only mentions the laws of the State of California.
* **Entire Agreement:** The contract content does not have a separate clause for "Entire Agreement", but it does mention that the agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties.
